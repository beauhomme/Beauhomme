Hi there! We're thrilled that you'd like to contribute to The Spese Portfolio Theme. Your help is essential for keeping it great.

Whatever your level of skill or however much time you can give, your contribution is greatly appreciated. There are many ways to contribute, from writing tutorials or blog posts, improving the documentation, submitting bug reports and feature requests, helping other users by commenting on issues, or writing code which can be incorporated into The Spese Portfolio Theme itself.

Following these guidelines helps to communicate that you respect the time of the developers managing and developing this open source project. In return, they should reciprocate that respect in addressing your issue, assessing changes, and helping you finalize your pull requests.

## How to report a bug

Think you found a bug? Please check [the list of open issues](https://github.com/quantumx-dev/Spese/issues) to see if your bug has already been reported. If it hasn't please [submit a new issue](https://github.com/quantumx-dev/Spese/issues/new).

Here are a few tips for writing *great* bug reports:

1. Describe the specific problem (e.g., "widget doesn't turn clockwise" versus "getting an error")
2. Include the steps to reproduce the bug, what you expected to happen, and what happened instead
3. Check that you are using the latest version of the project and its dependencies
4. Include what version of the project your using, as well as any relevant dependencies
5. Only include one bug per issue. If you have discovered two bugs, please file two issues
6. Even if you don't know how to fix the bug, including a failing test may help others track it down

> If you find a security vulnerability, do not open an issue. Please email [security@quantumx.dev](mailto:security@quantumx.dev) instead.

## How to suggest a feature or enhancement

If you find yourself wishing for a feature that doesn't exist in The Spese Theme, you are probably not alone. There are bound to be others out there with similar needs. Many of the features that The Spese Theme has today have been added because our users saw the need.

Feature requests are welcome. But take a moment to find out whether your idea fits with the scope and goals of the project. It's up to you to make a strong case to convince the project's developers of the merits of this feature. Please provide as much detail and context as possible, including describing the problem you're trying to solve.

[Open an issue](https://github.com/quantumx-dev/Spese/issues/new) which describes the feature you would like to see, why you want it, how it should work, etc.

## Your first contribution

We'd love for you to contribute to the project. Unsure where to begin contributing to The Spese Theme? Feel free to ask for help; everyone is a beginner at first. :smiley_cat:

## How to propose changes

Here's a few general guidelines for proposing changes:

1. If you are making visual changes, include a screenshot of what the affected element looks like, both before and after.
2. Follow the [Jekyll style guide](https://ben.balter.com/jekyll-style-guide).
3. If you are changing any user-facing functionality, please be sure to update the documentation.
4. Each pull request should implement one feature or bug fix. If you want to add or fix more than one thing, submit more than one pull request.
5. Do not commit changes to files that are irrelevant to your feature or bug fix.
6. Don't bump the version number in your pull request (it will be bumped prior to release).
7. Write [a good commit message](#writing-a-good-commit-message).

At a high level, [the process for proposing changes](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/) is:

1. [Fork](https://github.com/quantumx-dev/Spese/fork) and clone the project.
2. Configure and [install](README.md) theme.
3. Create a new branch: `git checkout -b my-branch-name`.
4. Make your change, add tests, and make sure the tests still pass.
5. Push to your fork and [submit a pull request](https://github.com/quantumx-dev/Spese/compare).
6. Pat your self on the back and wait for your pull request to be reviewed and merged.

**Interesting in submitting your first Pull Request?** It's easy! You can learn how from this *free* guide [Creating a pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request).

## Writing a Good Commit Message

1. Specify the type of commit:

   * feat: The new feature you're adding to a particular application.
   * fix: A bug fix.
   * style: Feature and updates related to styling.
   * refactor: Refactoring a specific section of the codebase.
   * test: Everything related to testing.
   * docs: Everything related to documentation.
   * chore: Regular code maintenance. 
   * You can also use emojis to represent commit types.

2. Separate the subject from the body with a blank line.

3. Your commit message should not contain any whitespace errors.

4. Remove unnecessary punctuation marks.

5. Do not end the subject line with a period.

6. Capitalize the subject line and each paragraph.

7. Use the imperative mood in the subject line.

8. Use the body to explain what changes you have made and why you made them.

9.  Do not assume the reviewer understands what the original problem was, ensure you add it.

10. Do not think your code is self-explanatory.
